# firelink

Do you like the philosophy behind [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad)? But perhaps you think that it has grown to be much more complex than it set out to be? And do you prefer to work with a more readable codebase with less restrictions on line counts? Then you've come to the right place!

firelink is obviously inspired by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad), and [karpathy/micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/) but aims to make the user and developer experience as intuitive and simple as possible, whilst maintaining a competitive performance.
